##CodeBook.md
This is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed on the raw data.
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing.  Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The data is located at the following url:

##Study Design
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

##Variables 
The dataset includes the following files:
- 'README.txt'
- 'features_info.txt'
        Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector
- 'features.txt'
       List of all features
- 'activity_labels.txt'
       Links the class labels with their activity name
- 'train/X_train.txt'	
       Training set
- 'train/y_train.txt'
       Training labels
- 'test/X_test.txt'
       Test set
- 'test/y_test.txt'
       Test labels
       
The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 
        - 'train/subject_train.txt'
Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
        - 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt'
The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
        - 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt'
The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
        - 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt'
The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
    mean(): Mean value
    std(): Standard deviation
    mad(): Median absolute deviation 
    max(): Largest value in array
    min(): Smallest value in array
    sma(): Signal magnitude area
    energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
    iqr(): Interquartile range 
    entropy(): Signal entropy
    arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
    correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
    maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
    meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
    skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
    kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
    bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
    angle(): Angle between to vectors.	

##Analysis Summary
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
To prepare the final tidy data set, I was tasked with creating one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 
    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Raw Data
Raw data = Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set The raw data can be downloaded here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
For more information on raw data files and other variables contained in the set, see README.txt provided in the data set.

##Data Prep
run_analysis.R performs all the necessary data cleaning and other prep necessary to obtain the required tidy data step for the Course Project Steps required to manipulate the data into the final today data set form are outlined in more detail in the Analysis Summary section of this code book. Detailed comments explaining each procedure are also included throughout the run_analysis.R code.

##Variables in Final Tidy Data Set
The final tidy data set required for the Course project can be found in dt_final.txt on this repo.
For each activity and each subject in the final today data set, the mean of each variable was ultimately calculated. Note that final variable (column names) included in the final tidy set are simply expanded versions based on the raw data provided in features.txt (See run_analysis_code STEP 4 for transformation to final variable names in dt_final.txt).
