##Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_CourseProject
This repo contains my Course Project materials for submission, including:
CodeBook.md = Code book describing variables, data, and any transformations and work performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R = Code created to accomplish the following requirements for the Course Project:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for eachmeasurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, it creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
   dt_final.txt = This is the final data output resulting from the run_analysis.R code.
